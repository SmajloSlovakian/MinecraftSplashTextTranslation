# MinecraftSplashTextTranslation
Starter project!
This was made to allow community to translate untranslatable things in minecraft like splashes or end text.
You dont have to follow any glossary but it is recommended to do!

# How to contribute
If you want to contribute just go to the Splash text translations/assets/minecraft/texts/    folder and find/create file of the text and translate.
you have to create pull requests in order for me to see your contribution and allowing your changes.
Once you have made your pull request you can edit the file from the pull request further.
You can also review changes in other pull requests too!

# How to download and use these translations
If you want to download this you need to click on the green button (get code) and download as zip, then unzip it until you get to the folder next to readme and that is what you put into resourcepack folder, (temporary hopefully) now search for your languages code which you can find here: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Language and remove the code (and space) from those files you found, thats all you need to do!

PS: i want script which will do this
