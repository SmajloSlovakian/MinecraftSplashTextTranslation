-Add the folder you've just opened to your "\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\" folder, go into Minecraft, settings, 
  Resource Packs and pick the pack which has just appeared.

How to get into the resourcepacks folder?
-Open Minecraft, go into settings, Resource packs, drag and drop the resourcepack into Minecraft window...
But wait! that doesn't work!
-Click on a button called "Open pack folder"



My project attempts to translate the untranslated texts in Minecraft such as splash text messages, end game credits and others.
It's a simple community project not affiliated with Mojang AB. nor Minecraft itself as it is run by a member of the community.
