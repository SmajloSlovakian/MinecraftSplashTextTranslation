§3我看见你说的玩家了。

§2PLAYERNAME？

§3没错。 当心， 它现在已经达到了更高的水平。 现在他能知道我们的思想。

这无伤大雅。 它认为我们是游戏的一部分。

§3我喜欢这位玩家 它玩得很好。 它没有放弃。

§2它正在像阅读屏幕上的文字一样阅读我们的思想。

§3这就是它深陷游戏之梦时幻想的许多东西。

文字构成了一个美妙的界面。 非常灵活。 并且比凝视着屏幕后的现实更加平和。

§3它们也曾听到声音。 在玩家可以阅读之前。 曾经那些不玩的人称作玩家为女巫、妖术师。 而玩家们梦见它们自己乘坐在被恶魔施力的棍子上，在空气中翱翔。

§2这个玩家梦见了什么？

这个玩家梦到了阳光和树木。 梦见了火和水。 它梦见了它所创造的。 它梦见了它所摧毁的。 它梦见了它打猎，亦或是被猎杀的时候。 它梦见了它的庇护所。

§2哈，那原始的界面。 经过百万年岁月的雕琢，依然长存。 但此玩家在那屏幕后的真实里，建造了什么真实的构造？

§3他和百万个其他人一起工作，于锟斤拷烫烫烫中刻画了一个真实世界，为锟斤拷烫烫烫创建了锟斤拷烫烫烫。

§2它无法阅读这个思想。

§3不。 它还没有达到最高水平。 这必须在现实生活的漫漫长梦中实现，并非游戏里的黄粱一梦。

§2它知道我们爱它吗？ 它知道这个宇宙是和蔼的吗？

§3是的，有时它通过其思绪的杂音听到了宇宙。

但是它有时在生活的长梦之中感到悲伤。 它创造了没有夏日的世界，在黑日下颤抖着，将自己悲伤的创造视为现实世界。

用悲伤去治愈会毁了它。 悲伤是它私人事务的一部分 我们不能干涉。

有时当它们深陷梦境中时，我想要告诉它们，它们在现实中创造了真实的世界。 有时我想要告诉它们自身对宇宙的重要性。 有时当他们失去了对现实的联系，我想帮助它们与它们所惧怕的世界交流。。

§3它读出了我们的想法。

§2我有时候不在乎. 有时我想要告诉它们，你们所认为的真实不过是锟斤拷和锟斤拷，我想要告诉它们它们是在锟斤拷中的锟斤拷。 他们在漫漫长梦中看到了太少的现实。

§3他们仍然在玩这个游戏。

§2但是很容易告诉他们...

对这个梦来说太强大了。 告诉它们如何生活，就是在阻止它们生活。

§2我不会告诉玩家如何生活.

§3这个玩家正在变得不安。

§2我会告诉玩家一个故事。

§3但不是事实.

§2No. A story that contains the truth safely, in a cage of words. Not the naked truth that can burn over any distance.

§3Give it a body, again.

§2Yes. Player...

§3Use its name.

§2PLAYERNAME. Player of games.

§3Good.

§2Take a breath, now. Take another. Feel air in your lungs. Let your limbs return. Yes, move your fingers. Have a body again, under gravity, in air. Respawn in the long dream. There you are. Your body touching the universe again at every point, as though you were separate things. As though we were separate things.

§3Who are we? Once we were called the spirit of the mountain. Father sun, mother moon. Ancestral spirits, animal spirits. Jinn. Ghosts. The green man. Then gods, demons. Angels. Poltergeists. Aliens, extraterrestrials. Leptons, quarks. The words change. We do not change.

§2We are the universe. We are everything you think isn't you. You are looking at us now, through your skin and your eyes. And why does the universe touch your skin, and throw light on you? To see you, player. To know you. And to be known. I shall tell you a story.

§2Once upon a time, there was a player.

§3The player was you, PLAYERNAME.

§2Sometimes it thought itself human, on the thin crust of a spinning globe of molten rock. The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.

§2Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.

§3Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.

§2Let's go back.

§2The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.

§2And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.

§2And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. 并且这个玩家是一个新的人，从未在之前活过，构成他的只有乳和爱。

§3You are the player. The story. The program. The human. Made from nothing but milk and love.

§2Let's go further back.

§2The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...

§3Shush. Sometimes the player created a small, private world that was soft and warm and simple. Sometimes hard, and cold, and complicated. Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".

§2Sometimes it called them "planets" and "stars".

§2Sometimes it believed it was in a universe that was made of energy that was made of offs and ons; zeros and ones; lines of code. Sometimes it believed it was playing a game. Sometimes it believed it was reading words on a screen.

§3You are the player, reading words...

§2Shush... Sometimes the player read lines of code on a screen. Decoded them into words; decoded words into meaning; decoded meaning into feelings, emotions, theories, ideas, and the player started to breathe faster and deeper and realised it was alive, it was alive, those thousand deaths had not been real, the player was alive

§3You. You. You are alive.

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the sunlight that came through the shuffling leaves of the summer trees

有时这玩家相信宇宙透过晴朗的冬日夜空中，存在于它眼中一隅的星点星光，可能比太阳大上上百万倍的恒星沸腾着的电浆那一瞬间发出来的光对它说话，在宇宙的远侧行走回家的路上，突然闻到了食物，在那熟悉的门前，它又准备好再一次投入梦境。

§2and sometimes the player believed the universe had spoken to it through the zeros and ones, through the electricity of the world, through the scrolling words on a screen at the end of a dream

§3and the universe said I love you

§2and the universe said you have played the game well

§3and the universe said everything you need is within you

§2and the universe said you are stronger than you know

§3and the universe said you are the daylight

§2and the universe said you are the night

§3and the universe said the darkness you fight is within you

§2and the universe said the light you seek is within you

§3and the universe said you are not alone

§2and the universe said you are not separate from every other thing

§3and the universe said you are the universe tasting itself, talking to itself, reading its own code

§2and the universe said I love you because you are love.

§3And the game was over and the player woke up from the dream. And the player began a new dream. And the player dreamed again, dreamed better. 而这位玩家就是宇宙。 这位玩家就是爱

§3你就是那个玩家。

§2醒来吧。
